# Road Accident Analysis and Visualization

## Overview

This project focuses on analyzing road accident data and visualizing key insights using **Microsoft Excel**. The goal is to identify trends, patterns, and risk factors to help in devising measures to reduce road accidents. The project includes data cleaning, transformation, and an interactive dashboard for real-time exploration of the dataset.

## Objectives

- Analyze the distribution and severity of road accidents across different regions and times.
- Identify key factors contributing to road accidents (e.g., time of day, weather conditions, road types).
- Visualize findings in an interactive and user-friendly dashboard.

---

## Dataset

 The dataset includes records of road accidents with details such as:
  - Date and time of accidents.
  - Location details (city, region).
  - Weather and road conditions.
  - Severity levels and types of accidents.
  - (CSV/Excel file with pre-defined columns.)

## Project Workflow

### 1. Data Cleaning
- Removed duplicate records and handled missing values.
- Standardized formats for date, time, and categorical data.
- Grouped and categorized accident severity levels.

### 2. Data Transformation
- Added calculated fields for:
  - Hour of the day (to analyze peak times for accidents).
  - Day of the week and month.
  - Accident density by region.
- Categorized weather and road conditions for easier analysis.

### 3. Data Visualization
- **Interactive Dashboard Features**:
  - Accident trends over time (line chart).
  - Accident severity distribution (bar and pie charts).
  - Regional accident density (map visualization).
  - Filters for weather conditions, road types, and time of day.

## Tools and Techniques

- **Microsoft Excel**:
  - Pivot Tables for summarizing data.
  - Conditional Formatting to highlight high-risk areas.
  - Charts: Line, Bar, Pie, and Map for visual insights.
  - Slicers for interactive filtering.

## Insights and Findings

- Peak accident times are during rush hours (8 AM - 10 AM, 5 PM - 7 PM).
- Adverse weather conditions (rain, fog) significantly increase accident risks.
- Urban regions have higher accident frequencies but lower severity rates compared to rural areas.
